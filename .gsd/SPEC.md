# SPEC.md — Project Specification

> **Status**: `FINALIZED`

## Vision
A highly professional, one-of-a-kind personal portfolio for a freelancer software engineer and AI enthusiast. The design is a minimal, architectural experience inspired by Vercel—clean, stark, and perfectly spaced. It features complex, fluid animations (like scroll-driven effects and particle backgrounds) to create a premium feel. The site also includes a unique "AI handprint"—a hidden Easter egg that showcases generative capabilities and AI collaboration, blending human engineering with artificial intelligence.

## Goals
1. Establish a minimal, high-end Vercel-like aesthetic.
2. Implement complex, 60fps animations that surprise and delight users without sacrificing performance.
3. Design and develop a functional, AI-driven Easter egg to showcase AI enthusiasm and capabilities.
4. Position the user as a top-tier freelancer capable of delivering cutting-edge, AI-assisted software.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Building a complex backend database (content is static/config-driven).
- An overwhelming, cluttered UI with too many loud colors.
- Over-engineering simple interactions (animations must be purposeful, not just noise).

## Users
- Potential freelance clients looking for premium, modern web development.
- Technical recruiters and engineering managers.
- Fellow developers and AI enthusiasts.

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Must be built using the existing Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion stack.
- **Performance**: High fidelity animations must not hurt First Contentful Paint (FCP) or lag on mobile.
- **Design**: Must strictly adhere to modern luxury/minimal aesthetics.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The landing page immediately conveys a "Vercel-level" premium tech brand.
- [ ] Scroll animations and page transitions are perfectly smooth and sophisticated.
- [ ] The AI Easter egg is implemented, discoverable, and impressive.
- [ ] The portfolio successfully highlights both software engineering skills and AI enthusiasm.
