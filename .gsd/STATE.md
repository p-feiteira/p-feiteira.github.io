## Current Position
- **Phase**: 4 (completed)
- **Task**: All tasks complete
- **Status**: Verified

## Last Session Summary
Phase 4 executed successfully. A complete `EasterEggProvider.tsx` context wrapper was authored and integrated correctly at the `layout.tsx` level. This conditionally invokes `<AiOverlay />`, presenting a unique Framer Motion powered bootup sequence mimicking an AI terminal interface to satisfy REQ-04. Both components live within the `@/components/common/` path space properly satisfying internal aliases.

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Phase 5
2. /plan 5
