## Current Position
- **Phase**: 5 (completed)
- **Task**: Final Audit
- **Status**: Verified Full Completion

## Last Session Summary
Phase 5 executed successfully. The site was completely reviewed against the initial specifications and plans. Build checks were thoroughly investigated using `.dvh` rendering rules for mobile, as well as fixing the final static Next.js TS compiler hook scoping warnings inside the `EasterEggProvider`. The website compiles smoothly. 

## Next Steps
- The MVP for the personal portfolio is complete. The site looks premium, operates responsively, and holds complex generative AI functionality under an Easter egg command. No further execution is required.
