# Plan 2.1 Summary

## Objective
Replace or update the current `Hero` and `Header` components to ensure vast white/dark spaces, precise alignment, and a purely minimal Vercel-like aesthetic.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Redesign Header for Minimalist Floating Navigation**: Refactored the header to use transparent backdrop-blur with a subtle border. Navigation links are now uppercase, tracked wider, and icons are thinner to ensure a sleek look.
2. **Redesign Hero Section with Deep Typography**: Rebuilt the hero to rely on massive `text-[8rem]` / `text-[10rem]` sized typography, increased white-space with `min-h-[85vh]` and stripped saturated styling from the image, converting it to a subtler grayscale avatar.

## Verification
- Both tasks were successfully verified ensuring the appropriate classes and styling directions exist. Header and Hero are strictly minimalistic and Vercel-like.
