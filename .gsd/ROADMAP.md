# ROADMAP.md

> **Current Phase**: Not started
> **Milestone**: v1.0

## Must-Haves (from SPEC)
- [ ] Vercel-like minimal architecture 
- [ ] Complex, fluid animations (Framer Motion)
- [ ] AI-driven Easter Egg
- [ ] Portfolio structure (hero, projects, skills, contact)

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup & Theming
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Establish a dark mode / minimal monochromatic base. Refine global styles and layout components, configuring standard fonts such as Inter or Geist.
**Requirements**: REQ-01, REQ-02

### Phase 2: Page Structure Strategy
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Replace the current layout or create new components (Hero, About, Projects, Footer) ensuring vast white/dark spaces and precise alignment.
**Requirements**: REQ-05

### Phase 3: Complex Motion & Transitions
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Integrate `framer-motion` to build a complex but smooth scrolling experience. We will explore things like parallax, text-reveal effects, or path-drawing animations for high visual impact.
**Requirements**: REQ-03, REQ-06

### Phase 4: The AI Easter Egg 
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Design and implement an interactive or generative visual experience. This might be a hidden console command, a subtle glow interaction that reveals AI agent behavior, or an interactive particle canvas (e.g., three.js or react-spring + canvas). This will serve as my unique AI signature.
**Requirements**: REQ-04

### Phase 5: Final Polish & Audit 
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: Audit performance, responsive layout fixes across all screen sizes, and verify the animations are butter smooth.
**Requirements**: REQ-06
